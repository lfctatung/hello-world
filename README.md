A **repository** is usually used to organize **a single project**. Repositories can contain **folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets** – anything your project needs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project. GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new repository.

By default your repository has one branch named master which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to master.

When you create a branch off the master branch, you’re making a copy, or snapshot, of master as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the master branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.

This is my first git project. 
The event sequence is shown below from branching and merging:

1. **Project** is "hello-world" with a Master branch and many other feature branches 
2. **Create** Branch out of the Master so that the branch has a snpashot of Master
3. Add or **Edit** files and Save changes by Commit one file change at a time 
4. **Pull request** for all the changes to that branch 
5. **Merge** to Master > **Delete** branch as Master has all the changes made to the branch.

Today is 3-28-2018 and I am following the [GitHub tutorial guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) for making a change to the README.md file.

Today is 4-29-2018 Sunday, I just finished a DSE Ocean Beach Great Parkway 3 miles run in 31.xx minutes. 

We have added a Python and a C code file.
