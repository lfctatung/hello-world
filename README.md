# hello-world
This is my first git project. 
The event sequence is shown below from branching and merging:
> **Project** is "hello-world" with a Master branch and many other feature branches 
> **Create** Branch out of the Master so that the branch has a snpashot of Master
> Add or **Edit** files and Save changes by Commit one file change at a time 
> **Pull request** for all the changes to that branch 
> **Merge** to Master > **Delete** branch as Master has all the changes made to the branch.

Today is 3-28-2018 and I am following the GitHub tutorial guide for making a change to the README.md file.
