# hello-world
This is my first git project. 
The event sequence is shown below from branching and merging:
1. **Project** is "hello-world" with a Master branch and many other feature branches 
2. **Create** Branch out of the Master so that the branch has a snpashot of Master
3. Add or **Edit** files and Save changes by Commit one file change at a time 
4. **Pull request** for all the changes to that branch 
5. **Merge** to Master > **Delete** branch as Master has all the changes made to the branch.

Today is 3-28-2018 and I am following the [GitHub tutorial guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) for making a change to the README.md file.

Today is 4-29-2018 Sunday, I just finished a DSE Ocean Beach Great Parkway 3 miles run in 31.xx minutes. 

We have added a Python and a C code file.
